About TransImp
===============

TransImp (Translation-based Spatial Transcriptomics Imputation toolkit) is a computational framework and toolbox for reference-based imputation of spatial transcriptomic dataset.

TransImp features in two novel functions: \
 1) Uncertainty score estimation for each imputed gene, allowing the identification of relible predictions; \
 2) Spatial regularisation for explicitily control the degree of spatial pattern preservation for imputation modeling.

Please refer to our demo notebooks for details:

* `Different configurations of TransImp applied to SeqFISH dataset dataset`_.

* `Exploration for unprobed genes with SeqFISH ST dataset`_.
